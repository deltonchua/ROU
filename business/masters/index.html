              <strong>True North: Discover Your Authentic Leadership</strong
              ><br />This book explains how and why becoming a genuine leader is
              possible for anyone and everyone. True North is based on research
              and first-person interviews with 125 of today’s top leaders. In
              this book, former Medtronic CEO Bill George shares the wisdom for
              being an authentic leader by outlining five key steps: 1) knowing
              your authentic self; 2) defining your values and leadership
              principles; 3) understanding your motivations; 4) building your
              support team; and 5) staying grounded by integrating all aspects

              <strong>Talent on Demand</strong><br />Peter Cappelli wrote this
              book to examine common talent management issues. It includes a
              slew of supply chain company examples and reveals four management
              principles for ensuring that your employees have the skills they
              need, exactly when they need them. After reading this book, you'll
              know how to balance developing talent in-house with hiring
              external employees, improve the accuracy of your talent-need
              forecasts, maximize productivity of your employees, and replicate
              an external job board by creating an internal one for current
              employees.

                >The Money of Invention: How Venture Capital Creates New
                Wealth</strong
              ><br />This practical guide is written by two industry experts
              (Paul A. Gompers and Josh Lerner) about the problems entrepreneurs
              encounter when securing financing, and how the venture capital
              model can help businesspeople to resolve those issues. It also
              includes details on how corporations, government institutions and
              non-profits can (and should) harness the power of the venture
              capital model when applying it in their own industries. Whether
              your industry is riding the way of massive growth or holding on
              during an economic slowdown, this book is a tactical guide for
              leveraging venture captial to begin or grow your business.

                >Many Unhappy Returns: One Man's Quest To Turn Around The Most
                Unpopular Organization In America</strong
              ><br />In 1997, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had the largest
              customer base in America -- but also the lowest approval rating of
              any government agency. At the time, congressional hearings
              revealed that IRS agents were being pressured to meet quotas for
              back taxes and penalties. Some agents admitted anonymously that,
              in order to hit these quotas, tax collectors would squeeze
              taxpayers for money they didn’t really owe. Charles O. Rossotti
              became commissioner of the IRS in 1997 and was tasked with
              rebuilding the organization. He was the first businessperson to
              head the IRS, and in this book, he tells the remarkable story of
              leadership and transformation of this organization.

              hugely successful? Two internationally renowned management experts
              (Jim Champy and Nitin Nohria) say the key ingredient is ambition.
              Their book The Arc of Ambition is a practical guide to harnessing
              your personal and professional ambition and leaving a legacy of
              accomplishment. It details examples from dozens of modern and also

                at a Time</strong
              ><br />I've gotta come clean and reveal this book wasn't actually
              on any of the syllabi I researched. But case studies about
              Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz were basically plastered all over
              them, which is why I'm including this in here. Schultz an
              exceptional and highly respected leader, and his book details one
              of the most triumphant business stories in decades. Starbucks
              started as a single coffee shop in Seattle and has grown into a
              worldwide corporation. In the book, Schultz illustratres the
              founding principles that defined Starbucks and shares the wisdom
              he's learned along the way.

              most successful innovation turnarounds in American history,

              efforts in the company's history. It demonstrates
              how transformation and innovation became a core component of the
